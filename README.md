How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  -  To ensure the software is functional, I’ll have a well written requirement analysis document so everything is clearly defined with their different uses. Additionally I will use several methods of testing such as; Unit Testing, and Integration Testing to name a few. Finally I will have code review done by peers who haven’t worked on the code base to check for logic errors, and general inefficiencies.
  - To secure my program I will use input validation, Authentication, Encryption, and following secure coding practices from OWASP.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  - In order to properly interpret user needs and incorporate them properly I do a thorough user research to define user interaction and requirements needed in the program. I will follow the Agile Development cycle in order to gather consistent feedback from the business side, enabling me to stay flexible in my work.

How do I approach designing software?
  1. Define Requirements Non-Functional & Functional
  2. Analyze User Needs 
  3. Create Design Document
  4. Create Prototype
  5. Develop the software w/ Agile Methodology 
  6. Test Code
  7. Deploy Code
  8. Maintenance & Update the Code
